This way the treatment for every call can be programmed to make agents available based on your business needs. This is a common strategy to bring more agents to the caller.

So, if you need help fixing your phone, you\u2019ll be connected to a technical expert instead of someone who only knows about orders. </p> <p>As part of this setup, when agents log in to the system, they choose the team to login which is assigned to the agent. For instance, if the agent is part of the East Technical Team, they login under that team\u2019s profile.
