### What you learned in this lab

We hope you had fun with these exercises. You learned  

1. About the simplicity of teams based routing
2. To fine tune teams based routing with call distribution groups and rank queues
3. To use skills, or attributes, and how when attached to contacts, can offer a flexible and powerful way to differentiate callers and yet lower administrative overheads
4. To develop new methods to consider CC metrics to perform routing decisions, something that wasn't available to us before

Thank you for being here, we hope this was worth your time
